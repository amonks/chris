# Xenakis Example Project

Here's an example Xenakis project.

To get started, download [this .zip file](http://f.monks.co/xenakis.zip), extract it into this folder, pull this folder up in a terminal, and run `xenakis/serve`.

* `build/` contains the built website, ready to go. it's updated when you run `xenakis/serve` or `xenakis/build`.
* `website/` is where files that should go into the built website go.
* `tags/` contains custom html tags for xenakis to use.
